## üìò Overview

This project presents a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment for a proposed city-wide operational technology (OT) system integrating AI-driven traffic and electrical grid management. The assessment highlights vulnerabilities in industrial control systems (ICS) using real-world malware case studies, threat modeling, protocol analysis, and mitigation strategies.

---

## üîç Scope

The project evaluates two main OT systems:

- **Traffic Control Systems** ‚Äì using NTCIP protocol over Port 19200
- **Electrical Grid Control Systems** ‚Äì using IEC 61850 over Port 102

Both systems were analyzed from a cybersecurity posture perspective, particularly in relation to city infrastructure, public safety, and operational continuity.

## üîê Key Topics Covered

- ICS/SCADA threat modeling using the **ICS Kill Chain**
- Malware case studies: **Stuxnet**, **Industroyer**, **BlackEnergy**, **Mirai**, **Havex**, **Triton**
- Vulnerability analysis of control protocols (NTCIP, IEC 61850)
- Pentest strategies: frequency, tools, remote vs. in-person testing
- Mitigation frameworks and security hardening recommendations
- Regulatory compliance mapping (e.g., NIST, CISA, Executive Orders)
